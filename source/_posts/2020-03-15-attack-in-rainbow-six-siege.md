## Attack in Rainbow Six: Siege

Attack in Rainbow Six: Siege is focused on clearing and taking the objective from the defenders in the time allotted. Failure to do so results in a loss. Below, I will be discussing the various playstyles and strategies that attacking players can use to come out on top.

**Support**

Support is a main support role that focused on opening up lines of sight and gathering intelligence for the rest of their team. Like anchors on defense, support players usually play more slow and methodical.

**Fraggers**

Like roamers, fraggers are often fast characters with less armour. Their playstyles are focused on being fast, as their main job is to eliminate enemy players. By using the information fed to them by their support players, they must use their speed and agility to outwit and outplay defenders.
