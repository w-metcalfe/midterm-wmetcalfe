## Defense in Rainbow Six Siege

Two teams go head to head in a Rainbow Six: Siege match; one attacking and one defending. In this article, I will be discussing the defending team, including playstyles and strategies.

In Rainbow Six: Siege, defenders must protect two bomb sites from the attackers. Due to the abundance of characters in Rainbow Six: Siege, there are many playstyles for players to choose from. Below, I will detail each playstyle, including the roles they play in ensuring a defender win.

**Anchor**

An anchor is a support player who stays close to the objective and provides intelligence to the rest of the team through the use of cameras placed around the building. Anchors are often slower characters with more armour. They are usually the last line of defense in a game.

**Roamer**

A roamer is an offensive player who strays from the objective. A roamer's main goal is to catch attackers off-guard, and delay as much time as possible. Roamers are often faster characters with less armour, so they are able to move quickly from position to position. They are usually the first line of defense.
