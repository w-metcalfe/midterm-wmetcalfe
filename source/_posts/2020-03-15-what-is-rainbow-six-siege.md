## What is Rainbow Six: Siege?

Rainbow Six: Siege is a tactical based first person shooter (FPS) video game focused on communication and team work. The game was developed and published by Ubisoft in 2015, and has seen a large amount of additions to the game in the form of post-launch content.

Rainbow Six: Siege features two teams of five players, each with a unique set of abilities and gadgets. One team must attack while the other must defend. Each team must use strategy, communication and teamwork in order to defeat the enemy team and win the game.

The abundance of playable characters in Rainbow Six: Siege creates more opportunities for different playstyles and roles, each dependant on the strategy and character choice of the player and team.
